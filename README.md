<h1>Hi👋🏼, I'm Sebastien Morazzani, (Web Developer) 🇫🇷</h1>
<p>
A web developer with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a love for building. I thrive on experimenting with new concepts and turning what I’ve just learned into real, working projects. Every line of code is a chance to explore, grow, and push my skills further — and when I’m not coding, I dive into other passions like technology, finance, and gaming.
